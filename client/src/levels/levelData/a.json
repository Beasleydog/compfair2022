    "What is HTML? It’s a tool to design and create web pages. HTML is the “standard markup language” for the Internet’s millions and millions of Web pages. If you know how to use HTML, you are equipped with everything you need to design your own website!",
  "HTML is an acronym that stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.\n\n  HTML is made up of a series of what are called elements. Every single HTML element is a command or label that tells a web browser the specific way to display or present content on a webpage.",
"All HTML elements are created by a start tag, webpage content, and then an end tag. \n\n\n Look for the < and > keys on your keyboard, you are going to need them often!\n An HTML element includes all text from the first (start) tag to the final (end) tag. Start tags look like <h1>. End tags are similar, but include a closing backslash. For example, </p>. A complete HTML element looks like this: <CODE><TagName>Content here!</TagName></CODE>"  ],
